                    Developed as a team of three a recreation of the adult card game Cards Against Humanity,
                    but with a lighter sense of humor respecting professional integrity.  The objective of this
                    game is to have fun by matching a response (white) card with a question (black) card and
                    vote for which match was funnier. Each player joins the game starting with 7 white cards.
                    The oldest one in the group starts the game by picking one black card out of the deck and every
                    player must answer with one of the seven cards in their hand. The person who picked the black card
                    gets to judge the other players' answer and whichever this person chooses, gets to keep the black card.
                    When the game ends, which can happen at any time, the player with the most black cards kept is the winner.

                    Developed a website for <a href="">Alexis Transport Inc.</a>, a puertorrican local moving company
                    that works for hundreads of clients each year. The company has its headquartes in Toa Baja, 
                    Puerto Rico and it specializes in short-distance and long-distance moving covering all 78 towns
                    of the island and Orlando, Florida. Alexis Transport Inc. was a not a very known company due 
                    to its limited online presence, but, with the implementation of its website,
                    it has seen an increment of around 15% in new clientele.

                    Developed a program using Java to hide a message inside a .ppm image
                    and a .ppm image inside another .ppm image. The project is based on the principles
                    of steganography which is the practice of representing information within 
                    another message or physical object, in such a manner that the presence of 
                    the information is not evident to human inspection. The program uses the console
                    for user input to choose the image the program will be working with
                    and if the object to be hidden would be a message or an image.
